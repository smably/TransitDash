TransitDash

TransitDash is a simple app that finds nearby public transit stops and their upcoming departures. So far, it's just a command-line utility, but I am to make it a location-aware web app with support for mobile browsers.

Requirements:
-Python 2.x (I think)
-geopy for geocoding of addresses
-MySQL database containing GTFS data
